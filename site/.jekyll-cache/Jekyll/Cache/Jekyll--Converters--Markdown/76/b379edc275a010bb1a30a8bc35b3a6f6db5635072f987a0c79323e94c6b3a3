I"x<p>This project was completed with another group partner as part of our Machine Learning course. The goal was to analyze a public dataset to determine different components that affect the quality of red wine compared to white wine. We used Python as our main tool to run various models on the dataset, create data visualizations, and extract the most relevant predictors.</p>
