<p>This is a design I made for my Humanities capstone project, “Illustrating Fiction,” in which we created drawings to accompany short stories and did our best to capture their theme.</p>

<p>The story I had was called “The Bouquet” by Kate McIntyre, which is about a meticulous to-be bride who is searching for her perfect wedding bouquet but is always unsatisfied. She visits an old florist’s shop, who finally is able to help her find what she’s looking for, though in an unconventional way. You can read the full story <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hzPdkc1ciQJ9pCkprBrvfzlLvp1uwA2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

<p>Below you can see some more illustrations I made for the final project, both paper sketch and digital.</p>
