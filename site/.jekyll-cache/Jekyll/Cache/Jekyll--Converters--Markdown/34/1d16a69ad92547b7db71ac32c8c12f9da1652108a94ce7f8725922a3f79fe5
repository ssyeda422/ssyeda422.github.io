I"·<p>My social science capstone or IQP was at the Monteverde, Costa Rica project center, with the <a href="https://www.reservasantaelena.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve (SER)</a> as our sponsor. Â As a whole, the SER plays a fundamental role within the local community, receiving nearly 40,000 visitors annually. But with COVID-19, there were serious economic repercussions for tourism-reliant communities like Monteverde; so our project work over the course of seven weeks was to create a <a href="https://app.lapentor.com/sphere/santa-elena-reserve?scene=602dac96e1a95f6690426be3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual tour</a> of the reserve to expand their outreach and promote further donations in the future.</p>

<p>We mainly designed our virtual tour based on data collected from past visitors, tour guides, and experts of the reserve - and as we developed the tour, we sent out drafts and collected survey feedback from users on social media like Instagram to identify possible areas of improvement.</p>

<p>We designed our tour using Google Street View to capture 360 shots at different locations. For the virtual tour itself, we used a free, open-source software called Lapentor so that our sponsor could continue to add to the tour in the future.</p>
