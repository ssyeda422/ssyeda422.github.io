This app was built with two other group members as part of a final project for Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing. We developed the application in Kotlin/Java, using Android studio to test functionality.&nbsp;

The purpose of this app is to help groups of people living together with meal planning and grocery shopping.

One of the main features allows users to schedule meals for the week and select recipes for each scheduled meal. The user can add people/create a group for each scheduled meal.&nbsp;
