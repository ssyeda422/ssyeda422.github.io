This project was completed for a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course over seven weeks. The purpose was to develop a high-fidelity prototype and understand the full iterative design process by implementing it hands on.

Below is a full layout of all the final prototype screens.

In each step, from storyboarding to wireframing to prototyping, we underwent various evaluations from others (heuristic evaluations, think-alouds, semi-structured interviews, etc.)

Below is an example of the study goals we wrote and carried out.
