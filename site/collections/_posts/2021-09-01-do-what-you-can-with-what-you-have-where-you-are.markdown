[Code Crafters](http://www.code-crafters.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is an ongoing &nbsp;research project that investigates the relationship between quilting and computational thinking.

In this project, I paired with a PhD student conducting user research on the Code Crafters generative quilt design software. We ran multiple pilot studies with people who identitied as "crafters" to understand their learning process as they navigated the software.

With the data from our pilot studies, we brainstormed several design themes for our learning goals and future direction of the software. From there, we developed simple wireframes and then a more [high-fidelity prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/55c28373-527c-416a-9c0c-0b8358d9dadc-0091/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which we will continue to use as we start to make changes to the software itself.
