This is a work I made for a final project in my first Graphic Design class. We had to choose a piece of literature and design our own cover spread for it, so this piece is just the artwork I designed to go on the title page. The whole process you can see below.

Here is the original sketch idea drawn on paper:

I then scanned this into Photoshop to trace over it digitally, and finally uploaded the vector to Adobe InDesign. Here is the full book cover spread:
